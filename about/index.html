			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I'm Belinda. I'm currently in the first year of a PhD in the School of Psychology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW, Sydney). I am pursuing research in the Cognition and Decision Sciences field. The goal is to learn enough about cognition so I can nudge the world towards being less selfish and more just. I'm currently look at how people jump to conclusions - and how they jump differently after seeing information again and again (hello insidious news cycle...)</p>
      
      <p>Before I moved to sunny Sydney, I lived on the other side of the country in sunny Perth. I completed my Bachelor of Science (Honours) at the University of Western Australia. In my Honours project, I looked at how individuals make decisions about the mechanics of climate change. I found that individuals used a lot of faulty assumptions to make objectively incorrect decisions. However, a lot of these assumptions went away when individuals talked to other individuals in groups! This taught me that we mustn't lose hope in humans. Also, talk to other humans.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not thinking about how people think, I like to run away to places with open skies and unreliable phone service. Camping in the forest, driving through the country, and floating in the ocean are particularly enjoyable activities. When I'm not being a privileged faux-hippie, I try to make the most of being in a cosmopolitan city, by getting to music gigs, seeking out vego food joints, and attending international film festivals.</p>
      
      <p>Oh, and I want to live in Scandinavia because I hear they treat women equally to men</p>
