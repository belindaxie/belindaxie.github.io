	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm Belinda. I'm currently in the first year of a PhD in the School of Psychology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW, Sydney). I'm currently look at how people jump to conclusions - and how they jump differently after seeing information again and again (hello insidious news cycle...)</p>
      
      <p>I was born and raised in Perth, where I completed my Bachelor of Science (Honours) at the University of Western Australia. In my Honours project, I looked at how individuals make decisions about climate change. I found that individuals used a lot of faulty assumptions, but a lot of these assumptions went away when individuals talked to other individuals in groups! This taught me that we mustn't lose hope in humans. Also, talk to other humans.</p>
      
      <p>When I'm not thinking about how people think, I like to run away to places with open skies and unreliable phone service. When I'm not being a privileged faux-hippie, I try to hear the music, eat the food, and see the films that come as perks to living in a big city.</p>
      
      <p>Do get in touch if you want to hear more about my research.</p>
