	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm Belinda. I'm currently in the second year of a PhD in the School of Psychology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW, Sydney). I conduct online studies to examine how people reason from repeated evidence. For example, suppose five friends each give you the same opinion - how much do you rely on that opinion? What if you found out those friends had all talked to each other before giving you the opinions? I think these questions are important in this modern news environment where the same information can be repeated/creatively 'upcycled' multiple times.</p>
      
      <p>I was born and raised in Perth, a where I completed my Bachelor of Science (Honours) at the University of Western Australia. In my Honours project, I looked at how individuals make decisions about climate change. I found that individuals used a lot of faulty assumptions when reasoning about emissions reduction, but these faulty assumptions were often corrected when individuals talked to other individuals in groups. So talk to each other, people! Especially those nasty people who don't always agree with you...</p>
      
      <p>Outside of my PhD, I enjoy running, hiking, and live music.</p>
