	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p>Since April 2021, I have been working as an Adviser in the <a href="https://behaviouraleconomics.pmc.gov.au/">Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA)</a>. At BETA, we apply behavioural insights to a range of issues that are a priority to the Australian Prime Minister and Cabinet.</p>
		
	<p>Prior to joining BETA, I completed my PhD in cognitive psychology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW, Sydney). I conducted online studies and ran computational models to examine how people reason from repeated evidence. For example, suppose three friends each give you the same opinion ("we need to act on climate change"). How much do you accept that opinion? What if you found out those friends had all talked to each other before giving you their opinions? What if instead, these three friends had never met each other before? I think these questions are important given the modern news environment where information can be repeated in different ways.</p>
      
      <p>I am also very interested in the psychology of climate change beliefs. Climate change has far-reaching consequences and I believe it is an issue of international and intergenerational justice. I think academic research in this field is best used to empower individuals and communities to take action. You can read more about my thoughts in this space at this <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p> -->
