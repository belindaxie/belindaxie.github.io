	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I am in the third year of a PhD in the School of Psychology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW, Sydney). I conduct online studies and run computational models to examine how people reason from repeated evidence. For example, suppose three friends each give you the same opinion. How much do you rely on that opinion? What if you found out those friends had all talked to each other before giving you the opinions? I think these questions are important given the modern news environment where information can be repeated multiple times.</p>
      
      <p>I am also very interested in the psychology of climate change beliefs. Climate change has far-reaching consequences and is the biggest problem of our time. Although it is important that we continue to conduct research in this field, I think it is just as important that I volunteer with organisations, attend strikes and protests, and contact our elected representatives.</p>
      
      <p>Outside of my PhD, I enjoy balcony gardening, hiking, and live music.</p>
