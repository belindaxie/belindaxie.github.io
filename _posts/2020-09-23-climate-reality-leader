Over a week at the end of August, I completed training to be a 'Climate Reality Leader'. This is a training program created by Al Gore that teaches people all over the world to be effective climate communicators. Across several evenings, we listened to Al Gore speak out the science of climate change, its impacts, and the solutions to mitigate climate change.
