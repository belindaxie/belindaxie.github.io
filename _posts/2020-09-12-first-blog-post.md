I read an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027249442030387X">awesome journal article</a> earlier this week. It was about how the framing of climate action relative to COVID-19 can affect people's support for climate action, and I thought to myself - "other people NEED to know about this research!".

The week before that, I participated in a brilliant online training to become a <a href="https://www.climaterealityglobaltraining.com/">Climate Reality Leader</a>. Again, I gained valuable knowledge and inspiration from this experience that I would love to share with others.

So I'm finally activating the 'blog' section of this website. I don't expect many (any) people to read this, but if you are here - I hope there is some info here that will inspire you to use your voice, skills, and energy however you can.
